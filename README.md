 Arduino code decode several Acurite devices OTA data stream.
  
  Decoding protocol and prototype code from these sources:
  Ray Wang (Rayshobby LLC)

  Written and tested on an ESP32 WROOM-32 Board
  using a RXB6 433Mhz Superheterodyne Wireless Receiver Module
  
  This works with these devices but more could be added
